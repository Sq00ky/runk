# Welcome to runk

## What runk?

runk is what got last night.

Joke, very funny.

runk better known as "Ronald's User Name Kruncher". Yep. That's it. Caveman take meme (https://twitter.com/6thgrade4ever/status/1433519577892327424). Caveman steal meme. Okay, that's enough caveman jokes.

Let's all face it, Hydra sucks. It's probably one of the least flexible tools to exist on the internet. It's not very verbose, it offers limited flexibility in modifying things like Content-Type (A specific value is hard coded in Hydra on HTTP-Post-Forms, making working with JSON difficult...) not to mention the syntax for Hydra is just utterly stupid.

The goal of runk is to take everything that sucks from Hydra and to fix it.
